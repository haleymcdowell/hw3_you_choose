HW3 - You choose
=================

For the last assignment, I'll give you a few choices and you can pick depending on what you feel like learning more about.

Option 1: Simulation
---------------------

In Module 4 we learned how to use SimPy to do discrete event simulation. Pick some relatively simple process that lends itself to being modeled with DES and build a SimPy model for it. Make up any data needed (just as I did in Module 4) and use your model to explore some relevant scenarios. Develop some minimal documentation so that others could try out your model. 

Option 2: Data wrangling/visualization/analysis
------------------------------------------------

In the last part of the course we'll learn about web scraping, see some plotting packages like Plotly, Seaborn and Bokeh, and do some datetime analysis. Pick some data oriented problem of interest to you and apply some of these techniques. For example, you might scrape some web page and then do some EDA using various plotting tools (and perhaps compare the tools). 

Option 3: Gecomputation
-----------------------------------------

In Module 6, we do a brief introduction to geocomputation with Python. You could do more with the OU land use analysis that is used in the module - e.g. we never really compare land use over the years. You can add more features to the map. Or, you could make a map of something entirely different using some combination of raster and vector data.

Deliverables
--------------

As we've done all term, use a cookiecutter to create a project structure and put it under version control. Create a readme file that tells me how to explore and try out your project. Zip the entire project folder and submit via Moodle.
